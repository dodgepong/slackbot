The deck is solid, but I'm not sure about the ID choice.
Have you tried it out of a different ID?
This seems like a weaker version of an existing deck.
I don't see you ever keeping Kate out of the remote.
Apparently you didn't get the idea behind "dies to Parasite".
I'd think getting Siphoned makes this deck fall apart.
It's not ETF?
Medium. This deck loses to it.
So how does this stop Keyhole?
Why is this not out of Near Earth Hub?
How do you win without Caprice?
This deck just loses to my deck that nobody else is playing.
This deck is so bad in the current meta.
What if the Runner trashes your economy?
Faust breaks all of your ice.
There's just so much ICE in Atman 4 range here.
So how do you stop anyone with D4V1D from getting in?
How are you going to outpace DLR?

I'm not a believer in trying to force a deck to be good.

Where's the tag punishment?
A premier candidate for NRDB deck of the week.
What if Edward Kim trashes all your operations?
I played a version of this. It did have completely different cards and strategy though, which I will suggest to include even though they don't fit your gameplan at all.
What if you play against Noise and he just mills all of your key pieces?
No Food?
Doesn't  this spoiled card that will come out 5 datapacks later just completely wreck your plan?
:damon: Clot is a crutch. It also ruins your game plan.
I think you could get away with cutting a Jackson here.
MWL restrictions really seem to hurt this.
This deck is DOA against Dan playing conservatively.
How is Team Sponsorship not in this deck? Rookie mistake...
Unfortunately, this just loses to Dog-Tribal Adam.
